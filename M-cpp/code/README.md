C++ Basic 2 Demo
================

This is a simple code demo that will show you when constructors and destructors
are called.

Constructors are called when objects are declared and initialized, while
destructors are called at the end of the **block** an object is declared.
This is usually at the end of the curly brace that closes that block,
but this example demonstrates that it is also the case for the ends of one-liner
conditional and looping statements.


Building and running
--------------------

To build, type `make`.
To run, just run `./cpp-basic-2`.

Feel free to modify the code as you wish to try out your own examples.
