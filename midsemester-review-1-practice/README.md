# Midsemester 1 Review Practice Problems
## Students should:
1. Go to each folder and read the README for instructions.
2. Try to solve the problem on their own.
3. Look at the solutions.txt to compare with what they got.


## How to test these programs on your own.
Clone the recitation repository with this command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cs3157/recitations.git
```
Go into the midsemester-review-1-practice folder.
```bash
cd midsemester-review-1-practice/
```
Copy Jae's solution for mylist.c into the memory folder.
```bash
cp ~location-of-mylist.c~ memory/
```
Go into each respective directory (bits, classify-pointer, git, makefile, memory) and test the program. Note that classify-pointer does not have a Makefile, which means it is not set up to be tested.
